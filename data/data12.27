A chemical element is a species of atom
having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei
that is, the same atomic number, or Z.
For example, the atomic number of oxygen is 8,
so the element oxygen consists of all atoms which have exactly 8 protons.
118 elements have been identified
of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the
remaining 24 being synthetic elements.
There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope
and 38 that have exclusively radionuclides, which decay
over time into other elements. Iron is the most
abundant element (by mass) making up Earth,
while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crustChemical
elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe.
However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary
observable matter makes up only about 15% of the matter
in the universe: the remainder is dark matter;
the composition of this is unknown, but it is not
composed of chemical elements.[3] The two lightest elements,
hydrogen and helium, were mostly formed in the Big Bang
and are the most common elements in the universe.
The next three elements (lithium, beryllium and boron)
were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are thus
rarer than heavier elements. Formation of elements with
from 6 to 26 protons occurred and continues to occur in
main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The
high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron on Earth
reflects their common production in such stars.
Elements with greater than 26 protons are formed
by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which,
when they explode, blast these elements as supernova
remnants far into space, where they may become incorporated
into planets when they are formed.
